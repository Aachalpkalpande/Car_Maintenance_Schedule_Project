Your task is to build a simple frontend for a car maintenance schedule web app. The frontend must be built using React, Redux and Redux-Saga

Description:
	This is a web app to keep track of car maintenance record in a car garage. You’ll be given a python/flask based backend with following APIs:
Create user
Get all users
Get one user by id

Create a car record linked with a user
Get all car records for a user
Get records for one specific car by id

Create a servicing record for a car
Get all servicing records for a car

API details on the next page. We’ll provide backend code for development and testing.

Your task is to build a SPA with 2 tabs/pages. 1. for user management 2. for car and servicing records management. 

Both pages should have a  form for creating new record and list all records. On clicking a record, its details should be expanded. 

There should be a button/link to go from user to car details page and vice-a-versa.
